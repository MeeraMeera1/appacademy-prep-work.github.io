# Next Step: Technical Interview
App Academy's technical interview will consist of a series of timed coding challenges. For each question, you will have the option to write a solution in Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, or Java. When the time comes, don't worry about perfect solutions! We accept partial solutions, and overall logic is more important to us than exact syntax.

## Pointers
  - We need to know how you communicate the way you solve problems.
    - **Talk** us through your approach as you work through the problem.  
  - We want to evaluate you on your own work, so the interview is closed-book.
    - Use your interviewer and **ask** them questions. They'll be happy to help!
  - You won't be able to run your code in any REPL or interpreter.
    - Take sometime to **practice** writing working code without the help of a REPL.

## Additional Practice
One of the best ways to build your programming chops is to get a lot of practice solving problems and puzzles. This list, while not comprehensive, is a good starting point (and should keep you occupied for quite a while).

- [Ruby Monk][ruby-monk]: Interactive lessons from beginning to intermediate Ruby
- [Code Wars][code-wars]: A collection of coding challenges, rated by difficulty. This one is my favorite, since once you solve a problem, you can see other programmers' solutions.
- [Project Euler][project-euler]: More coding challenges. The first few are fairly straightforward and can be brute-forced. As you get further into the challenges, you'll have to be more clever about optimizing your algorithms.
- [Code Eval][code-eval]: More coding challenges, broken into three
  categories by difficulty. Fairly heavy on file input/output, can be difficult to debug.
- [LeetCode][leetcode]: A platform for preparing for technical coding interviews. The code you submit isn't only evaluated for correctness, but speed as well.
