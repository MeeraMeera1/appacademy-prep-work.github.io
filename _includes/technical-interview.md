# Next Step: Technical Interview

In the technical interview, we try to get a feel for how you work through
problems and communicate about code.

This will include solo timed coding challenges along with some pair
programming. You may use Ruby, JavaScript, Python, or Java. We will be using
a webcam to video-chat over Skype (plus a browser-based text editor to write
code together). There's no need to dress up, but you should come well
prepared.

## Technical Interview Prep Work

Work through our [Introduction to Programming I & II Courses][intro-to-programming]. These courses are
designed to introduce concepts that may come in handy during your technical
interview. Included are many practice problems and video walkthroughs to give you opportunities to practice your new skills. When accessing the courses, be sure to have the correct course selected by clicking "Course Outline" in the top left corner and switching to "Introduction to Programming" if you do not already have it selected.

Read our [introduction to pair programming][pair-programming]. Your interview
involves pair programming. Come in prepared by already understanding how pairing works.

As you work through the [Introduction to Programming courses][intro-to-programming] courses. Make sure you can
solve all problems in 15 minutes or less, any problems or concepts from the course is fair game for an interview.  The practice problems cover many of the strategies needed to solve the types of questions that you will 
experience in your interview, so make sure you are able to solve them and explain your solution. During
your interview you will need to not only produce a solution, but you will also be required to explain your approach in detail as well. So be sure to watch our video walkthroughs and listen to how we verbalize code clearly.


## Pointers

+ We need to know how well you can communicate about programming and your own code.
  + Talk us through your approach as you work through the problem.
+ We want to evaluate you on your own work, so the interview is closed-book.
  + **Ask** your interviewer questions, especially if they're related to syntax or your general approach to a problem. They'll be happy to help!
+ You won't be able to run your code in any REPL or interpreter.
  + Take some time to **practice** writing working code without the help of a REPL.
  + Speed is important. Time yourself to recreate a testing environment.
+ Bugs will come up.
  + Practice breaking up your code into manageable parts.
  + Be able to interpret the value (and type) of variables at any point in your method.
+ Make sure you can type quickly and accurately. Your time is limited, so
don't get bogged down by your keyboard! Here are a few resources for
practice:
  + [typing.io](https://www.typing.io): Free, designed for programmers.
  + [keybr](http://www.keybr.com/#!practice): General touch typing practice

Keep the following in mind when approaching problems:

Once you're getting pretty good at solving the problems, add in some extra challenges:

- Mentally step through your code. Practice until you can track every variable at every line without any trouble.
- Try solving the problem without running your code until the very end. Try to get to the point where you can write bug-free code without running it.
- Try explaining your solution to someone else, even if they donâ€™t know any code. Get feedback from them. See if you can talk them through it _as_ you come up with your solution. Practice until they can easily follow your thoughts.
- If you have the opportunity, practice [pair programming][pair-programming] with someone who knows how to code.
