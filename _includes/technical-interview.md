# Next Step: Technical Interview
App Academy's technical interview will consist of a series of timed coding challenges. We will be using a webcam to video-chat over Skype (plus a browser-based text editor to write code together). There's no need to dress up or take it too seriously; this is purely so we can get a better feel for who you are and how you work through problems.

You will have the option to code in Ruby, Python, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, or Java. During the interview, don't worry about perfect solutions! We accept partial solutions, and overall logic is more important to us than exact syntax.

## Pointers
  - We need to know how well you can communicate about programming and your own code,.
    - **Talk** us through your approach as you work through the problem.  
  - We want to evaluate you on your own work, so the interview is closed-book.
    - **Ask** your interviewer questions specially if they're related to syntax or your general approach to a problem. They'll be happy to help!
  - You won't be able to run your code in any REPL or interpreter.
    - Take some time to **practice** writing working code without the help of a REPL.
    - Speed is important. Time yourself to recreate a testing environment.
  - Bugs will come up.
    - Practice breaking up your code into manageable parts.
    - Be able to interpret the value (and type) of variables at any point in your method.

## How To Prepare
One of the best ways to build your programming chops is to get a lot of practice solving problems and puzzles. This list, while not comprehensive, is a good starting point (and should keep you occupied for quite a while).

- [Code Wars][code-wars]: A collection of coding challenges rated by difficulty. Once you solve a problem, you can see other programmers' solutions.
- [Project Euler][project-euler]: The first few challenges are fairly straightforward and can be brute-forced. As you get further into the challenges, you'll have to be more clever about optimizing your algorithms.
- [Code Eval][code-eval]: Coding challenges broken into three
  categories by difficulty. Fairly heavy on file input/output, so it can be difficult to debug. Alternatively, try making your own tests.
- [LeetCode][leetcode]: A platform for preparing for technical coding interviews. The code you submit isn't only evaluated for correctness, but speed as well.

Keep the following in mind when approaching problems:

- Prompts are often tagged with the topics covered. "Algorithms" and "Data Types" will be helpful but avoid "Regular Expressions".
- Aim to spend at most 30 minutes per problem.
- Take a look at the solution and learn as much as you can from it.
- Challenge yourself but avoid wasting time if it's not a learning experience.
