# Next Step: Technical Interview

In the technical interview, we try to get a feel for how you work through
problems and communicate about code.

This will include solo timed coding challenges along with some [pair
programming][pair-programming]. We will be using a webcam to video-chat over
Skype (plus a browser-based text editor to write code together). There's no
need to dress up, but you should come well prepared.

Unless otherwise stated, you will have the option to code in Ruby, Python,
JavaScript or Java. Don't get discouraged if you fail to complete a problem
during the interview. We accept partial solutions, and overall logic is more
important to us than exact syntax.

## Pointers

+ We need to know how well you can communicate about programming and your own code.
  + Talk us through your approach as you work through the problem.
+ We want to evaluate you on your own work, so the interview is closed-book.
  + **Ask** your interviewer questions, especially if they're related to syntax or your general approach to a problem. They'll be happy to help!
+ You won't be able to run your code in any REPL or interpreter.
  + Take some time to **practice** writing working code without the help of a REPL.
  + Speed is important. Time yourself to recreate a testing environment.
+ Bugs will come up.
  + Practice breaking up your code into manageable parts.
  + Be able to interpret the value (and type) of variables at any point in your method.
+ Make sure you can type quickly and accurately. Your time is limited, so
don't get bogged down by your keyboard! Here are a few resources for
practice:
  + [typing.io](https://www.typing.io): Free, designed for programmers.
  + [keybr](http://www.keybr.com/#!practice): General touch typing practice

## How To Prepare

Work through our [step 2 curriculum][step-two-curriculum]. This material is
designed to introduce concepts that may come in handy during your technical
interview. Included are several practice assessments to give you opportunities
to practice your new skills.

Read our [introduction to pair programming][pair-programming]. Your interview
involves pair programming. Come in prepared by already understanding how pairing
works.

Work through our [practice problems][practice-problems]. Make sure you can
solve all problems including the "hard" level in 15 minutes or less, as the hard
problems are most similar in difficulty to what you will experience in the
interview. The list of practice problems covers many of the strategies needed
to solve the types of questions that you will experience in your interview,
so make sure you are able to solve them and explain your solution. During
your interview you will need to not only produce a solution, but you will be
required to explain your approach in detail as well.

Solve and review others' solutions from [this list of problems][curated-problems].
We have chosen these problems carefully as they are similar in difficulty and
concepts exercised to our harder interview questions.

## Additional Practice

Practice solving problems and puzzles... _a lot_. The best thing you can do to
prepare for a technical interview is to spend many hours solving a great number
of problems. Here is a list of additional resources to check out to get some
more practice. You may need to make an account to use some of these services.

- [Code Wars][code-wars]: A collection of coding challenges rated by difficulty. Once you solve a problem, you can see other programmers' solutions.

- [Code Fights][code-fights]: Fun way to practice and test your programming skills against other programming players and bots. Let the fight begin.

- [Project Euler][project-euler]: The first few challenges are fairly straightforward and can be brute-forced. As you get further into the challenges, you'll have to be more clever about optimizing your algorithms.

- [LeetCode][leetcode]: A platform for preparing for technical coding interviews. The code you submit isn't only evaluated for correctness, but speed as well.

Keep the following in mind when approaching problems:

- Prompts are often tagged with the topics covered. "Algorithms" and "Data Types" will be helpful, but you will not need to know "Regular Expressions".
- Aim to spend at most 30 minutes per problem.
- Take a look at the solution and learn as much as you can from it.
- Challenge yourself but avoid wasting time if it's not a learning experience.

Once you're getting pretty good at solving the problems, add in some extra challenges:

- Mentally step through your code. Practice until you can track every variable at every line without any trouble.
- Try solving the problem without running your code until the very end. Try to get to the point where you can write bug-free code without running it.
- Try explaining your solution to someone else, even if they donâ€™t know any code. Get feedback from them. See if you can talk them through it _as_ you come up with your solution. Practice until they can easily follow your thoughts.
- If you have the opportunity, practice [pair programming][pair-programming] with someone who knows how to code.
