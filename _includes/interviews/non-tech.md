# Next Step: Non-Technical Interview

## Overview
The non-technical interview is an opportunity to learn more about you. We are looking for candidates who have the skills necessary to persist through the rigor of App Academy, positively contribute to their cohorts, and succeed in the job search. This interview is conducted via **[Zoom][zoom]**, requires a steady internet connection and functional webcam, and is recorded for evaluation and quality assurance purposes. Read on to learn about how we evaluate interviews and how you can best prepare.
 
 
## What We are Looking For
**Professional presentation skills**: We know that many of our candidates are fairly new to the interview process, so we do not expect perfection. We are looking for candidates who are prepared for the interview, present themselves in a positive light, and can speak to their accomplishments and goals. Be sure to carefully review the tips on this page, and practice with the example questions provided.

**Professional English language proficiency**: We want to ensure that our students have the English language proficiency needed to keep up with the program’s rigorous pace and communicate well with others in the cohort, especially during pair programming.

**Resilience and work ethic**: Most students put in 70-100 hours a week for the duration of the program. In the non-technical interview, we are looking for evidence that you are prepared for the rigor of the program and have developed strategies for managing your time and stress.

**Enthusiasm**: Enrolling in App Academy is a huge commitment. We want to know WHY you want to become a software engineer and WHY App Academy is the best program to help you achieve your goals. 

**Teamwork**: Much of a typical day at App Academy involves pair programming, and becoming a great software engineer requires the ability to collaborate, communicate, and problem solve with other people.
 
 
## How to prepare
1. Practice your personal pitch. This is a 2-3 minute spiel about your educational and professional background, why you want to become a software engineer, and why App Academy is a good fit.
2. Practice the example questions below and familiarize yourself with the confirmation questions. 
3. Consider recording your personal pitch and reviewing the video, so that you can see what aspects of your presentation you might need to work on. Your body language is equally as important as your choice of words. 
4. Consider asking friends or family to do a mock interview with you, using the example questions provided below, and give you feedback. 
 
 
## Interview Tips
* Stick to 3-minutes for the personal pitch. You do not need to give a play-by-play of your career. Cover the general trajectory of your background, and your interviewer will ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear.
* Cover why you are interested in software engineering and App Academy.
* Be mindful of filler words (um, like, so, and). It’s okay to take pauses as you are formulating thoughts.
* Breathe, smile, sit up straight, and make eye contact. Your body language helps to convey your confidence and your enthusiasm.
* Focus on the positive. Don’t put yourself or others down. Reframe setbacks in your life as opportunities for growth.
  
  
## Example questions
We do not provide the interview questions ahead of time so that you can provide more organic, rather than memorized, responses. Here are the types of questions we will ask, but they are **not** the exact questions you will be given:
* What is your background and what are your career goals?
* Why is App Academy the right fit for you?
* How have you overcome communication issues when working on a team?
* Have you ever taught yourself a new skill?
* What obstacles have you overcome in your life? 
* What is an example that demonstrates your drive to succeed?
* How have you worked with diverse groups of people? 
  
   
## Confirmation questions
Be prepared to answer all of these questions.
* What is your preferred start date? *This does not affect your admissions decision.*
* Which tuition plan would you prefer? *This does not affect your admissions decision.*
* It takes students an average of 3-6 months to find a job after the curriculum ends. However, keep in mind that it could take up to 12 months. Are you in a financial position where you could support yourself without any employment for that entire period?
* Do you need an admissions decision by a certain date? *We aim to review all interviews within 3 business days, and will try to expedite the review process if you require a response sooner.*
