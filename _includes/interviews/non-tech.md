# Next Step: Non-Tech Interview

## Overview
This interview is an opportunity to learn more about you. We are looking for candidates who have the skills necessary to persist through the rigor of App Academy, positively contribute to their cohorts, and succeed in the job search. This 25-minute interview is conducted via [Zoom][zoom], requires a steady internet connection and functional webcam, and is recorded for evaluation and quality assurance purposes. Most interviews are conducted by recent App Academy graduates, who are in the process of finding their first full-time software engineering job. Read on to learn about how we evaluate interviews and how you can best prepare.
 
 
## What We are Looking For
**Professional presentation skills**: We know that many of our candidates are fairly new to the interview process, so we do not expect perfection. We are looking for candidates who are prepared for the interview, present themselves in a positive light, and can speak to their accomplishments and goals. Be sure to carefully review the tips on this page, and practice with the example questions provided.

**Professional English language proficiency**: We want to ensure that our students have the English language proficiency needed to keep up with the program’s rigorous pace and communicate well with others in the cohort, especially during pair programming.

**Resilience and work ethic**: Most students put in 27.5 hours a week from the SWE Online Part-Time program, 60-80 hours a week for the SWE Online 24-week program, and 80-100 hours a week for the Campus-Hybrid 16-week program. In the interview, we are looking for evidence that you are prepared for the rigor of the program and have developed strategies for managing your time and stress. Note:  For our Full-Time programs, you cannot work during the duration of the course or the job search.

**Enthusiasm**: Enrolling in App Academy is a huge commitment. We want to know WHY you want to become a software engineer and WHY App Academy is the best program to help you achieve your goals. 

**Teamwork**: Much of a typical day at App Academy involves pair programming, and becoming a great software engineer requires the ability to collaborate, communicate, and problem solve with other people.

**Openness to diversity**: App Academy is committed to cultivating an inclusive environment for students from all backgrounds. This includes students of all genders and sexual orientations, from different cultural, racial, ethnic, religious, educational, and professional backgrounds, spanning a wide range of ages. We want to see that you will contribute to a positive, respectful learning environment for all students, including students whose backgrounds differ greatly from your own.
 
 
## How to prepare
1. Practice your personal pitch. This is a 2-3 minute spiel about your educational and professional background, why you want to become a software engineer, and why App Academy is a good fit.
2. Practice the example questions below. 
3. Consider recording your personal pitch and reviewing the video, so that you can see what aspects of your presentation you might need to work on. Your body language is equally as important as your choice of words. 
4. Consider asking friends or family to do a mock interview with you, using the example questions provided below, and give you feedback. 
5. Explore the curriculum on [App Academy Open] [aao] to see how you like coding and App Academy's instructional style.
 
 
## Interview Tips
* Prepare for the interview using the provided materials.
* Practice a short (<3 minutes) personal pitch. Cover the general trajectory of your education, career, and coding background.
* Demonstrate your enthusiasm for software engineering.
* Articulate why App Academy is the right fit for you.
* Share specific, relevant answers to the questions presented.
* Emphasize how your experiences have prepared you for the rigors of App Academy. We want to know what strategies you have developed to manage your time and stress.
* Be mindful of filler words (um, like, so, and). It’s okay to take pauses as you are formulating thoughts.
* Be mindful of what’s in view in the background of your video. 
* Breathe, smile, sit up straight, and make eye contact. Your body language helps to convey your confidence and your enthusiasm.
* Focus on the positive. Don’t put yourself or others down. Reframe setbacks in your life as opportunities for growth.
* Remember that we want to see how you would present yourself in a professional interview setting.

## What Not to Do
* Leave the interviewer confused about why you are interested in App Academy and software engineering.
* Ramble or go on long tangents.
* Mumble, slouch, and avoid eye contact.
* Give vague, generic answers that don’t speak to your specific experiences.
* Overshare personal information.
* Stare ahead stone-faced and unsmiling.
* Talk negatively about yourself or others.
* Frame your success in terms of being better than others.
* Downplay your accomplishments.
* Take the interview in a dark room, your car, a cafe, or a chaotic environment.
* Vape, smoke, or eat.

  
## Example questions
We do not provide the interview questions ahead of time so that you can provide more organic, rather than memorized, responses. Here are the types of questions we will ask, but they are **not** the exact questions you will be given:
* What is your background and what are your career goals?
* Beside the potential salary and flexibility, why do you want to become a software engineer?
* What have you done to explore coding?
* Why is App Academy the right fit for you?
* How have you overcome communication issues when working on a team?
* What obstacles have you overcome in your life? 
* What experiences in your life have prepared you for App Academy?
* What is an example that demonstrates your drive to succeed?
* How do you think we can ensure that App Academy is an inclusive environment for students of all backgrounds?
