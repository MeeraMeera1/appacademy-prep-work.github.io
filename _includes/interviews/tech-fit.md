# Next Step: Interview

In order to be a successful software engineer, you need both strong technical skills and soft skills. Job interviews require mastery of both.

Your next step will be an interview that contains both technical and behavioral questions along with some pair programming.

Doing some preparation for this interview is important. This guide will walk you through what you need to do. The interview lasts around 50 minutes, but you should probably spend 2-10 hours preparing, depending on how strong your coding background is, how much work you've done on your resume and how familiar you are with interviewing and personal sales.

That said, there's no reason to freak out or try to master it all. We don't expect perfection; we're just looking for some potential. See you in the interview!
