## Pair Programming

Students do a lot of collaborative work in our program, so we will do some pair programming with you in the interview to see how well you work with others. It's also good to try it out since it's something we do a lot of in our program.

### Driving and Navigating

Start by watching [this introductory video][pairing-video].

In pair programming, two programmers work together at one workstation. The **driver** types at the keyboard while the **navigator** directs the driver.

The foundation of pair programming is communication. Both partners should always be on the same page. The navigator directs the driver, but the driver will often need clarification about what the navigator intends for them to do, and any disagreements should be talked through.

#### Driving

1. Don't ignore the navigator's instructions or go off typing what they haven't instructed you. If you disagree, try to work it out, but ultimately _they_ are the one to decide.
2. You should _understand_ the code you're typing. Don't just blindly follow directions. You can ask them to explain the strategy to you.
3. Be patient. Give your partner some time to come up with a plan of action, even if you have an idea of what you want to do next.
4. If the navigator gets stuck, talk through it with them. You can make suggestions, ask for clarification, and even challenge them a little bit. Remember that the key is communication.

#### Navigating

1. Be engaged. Your driver is waiting to execute your algorithm, so do your best to lead in a good direction.
2. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Navigating doesn't mean you have to know exactly what to do at any given time. Part of what makes pair programming great is that you can talk it through with your partner and give each other ideas.
3. Be patient. If the driver doesn't understand, explain the strategy it to ensure you're both on the same page.
4. Don't micromanage. Your driver understands how to code - you don't have to dictate the exact code for them to type. Try for something higher-level like, "Make an if block with condition X," or "Let's create a loop that uses method Y to do Z."
