## CodePair

We will be using HackerRank's CodePair platform which is a browser-based text editor with integrated video chat. Make sure you have a webcam and a good internet connection. It is also best if you use [Chrome][chrome] or [Firefox][firefox] as your browser.

The CodePair environment has a feature to run your code. You may use it, but you shouldn't rely on it. If you want to run your code in the interview, ask your interviewer and be sure you know exactly what you expect the code to output. Also be prepared to debug any error messages you might get.

The interview is closed-book (no notes or external websites), but you may ask your interviewer questions, especially if they're related to syntax or your general approach to a problem. They'll be happy to help!

We will email you a link to join the CodePair interview room shortly before the scheduled interview time. It helps if you join the room early so that you can read the instructions and try out the platform ahead of time.
