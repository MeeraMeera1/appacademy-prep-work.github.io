## CodePair

We will be using HackerRank's CodePair platform which is a browser-based text editor with integrated video chat. Make sure you have a webcam and a good internet connection. It is also best if you use [Chrome][chrome] or [Firefox][firefox] as your browser.

We will email you a link to join the CodePair interview room shortly before the scheduled interview time. It helps if you join the room early so that you can read the instructions and try out the platform ahead of time.
