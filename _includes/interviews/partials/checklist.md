## Interview Prep Checklist

### In the days leading up to your interview

* [ ] Download and test out video chat on [Zoom][zoom]. 
* [ ] Practice a 2-3 minute pitch about your background, your career goals, and why App Academy is the best fit for you.
* [ ] Practice the example interview questions and review the confirmation questions.
* [ ] Figure out which start date ([SF][sf], [NY][ny], [Online][online]) and tuition plan ([In Person][in-person-tuition], [Online][online-tuition]) you prefer. These questions are for administrative purposes. Your answers will not affect your admissions decision.
* [ ] Look through the [FAQ][faq] and list out any further questions you may have. You can ask your interviewer when the time comes.
* [ ] Take a photo or get a copy of your high school (secondary school) diploma or transcript. If you are accepted, you will be required to email this before you enroll.


### The day of your interview:

- [ ] Make sure that your webcam is functional and your internet connection is steady.
- [ ] Check that the background of your video looks clean and that your face is well-lit in the frame.
- [ ] Check the email you input on your application for a link to the interview at your scheduled interview time.
- [ ] Take a deep breath and remember to smile. We are excited to get to know you better.
