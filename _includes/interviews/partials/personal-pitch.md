## The Personal Pitch

> "So, tell me about yourself. What have you done in your career and what brought you here?"

Unnatural as it feels, this formality will likely be the first question you get in a job interview. Since your answer will also be longer than most parts of the conversation, your interviewer is likely to sit back, listen to you talk, and decide whether to take your candidacy seriously. Depending on your interviewer, this can significantly affect the outcome of the entire conversation.
If you're good at selling yourself, this is where you shine. Otherwise no worries. A two-minute, well-rehearsed spiel is all you need to sound prepared and professional.

At App Academy, we use this question to gauge how applicants will fare once they're through our program and interviewing for dev roles. But unlike many of the interviewers you'll encounter, we want to be perfectly clear what we expect of you. We'll give you all the tools you need to succeed. It's up to you to pick them up and use them!

### Your Triangle

People tend to remember things in **threes**. What are the **three** points you want your interviewer to remember? Try to use these ideas:

1. A brief (1min) overview of your past life, i.e. where did you go to school, what did you do after, etc.
2. Why do you want to become a developer?
3. How will App Academy help you achieve your goal? (i.e. Why a bootcamp? Why App Academy specifically?)

Don't overcomplicate this. Keep it easy, fun and simple for you and your interviewer. Here's a sample outline to help you get the idea:

#### Beginning

> I went to school at _[...]_ university. In college I chose to major in _[...]_ and took a lot of classes in _[...]_ because I like working on problems that involve _[...]_. Post that I worked at _[...]_ as a _[...]_. At [company] I accomplished _[...]_ and _[...]_ and built skills _z_, _y_ and _x_.

#### Middle

> I've always had an affinity for computers so I taught myself HTML and JavaScript for fun...

#### End

> When I picked up Ruby two years ago, I immediately got hooked. I was playing around on Ruby Monk every day after work. Now I want to learn more because _[... ...]_, and that's when I found App Academy. I really liked how you _[...]_, so I applied.

Notice that each part of the story includes specific details. A few specifics are critical for your listener to fully understand your story. Remember, a story has a beginning, middle and an end (_three_ parts).

### Practice

Having a good Personal Pitch will help your professional development now and down the road. The best way to practice your Personal Pitch is to record yourself. As adults, we learn much faster when we can see and hear ourselves. Also, ask friends or family to listen and provide honest feedback.

When reviewing your pitch check to see that you...

* keep good flow and don't use too many filler words (um, like, so, and).
* stick to the point and stay concise. Don't be afraid to cut content if you're running long. Remember that attention spans are short these days. Your whole pitch should take no more than 3 minutes.
* don't speak too fast! Remember to _breathe_.
* speak clearly and confidently.
* use good speech dynamics: positive energy, tone and volume.
* speak with your body, not just your voice. This includes eye contact (when appropriate). Remember that people intuitively judge you based on your body language, so it is often _more_ important than what you say.

### Follow-up Questions

Your interviewer will ask you some other questions as well. You should spend some time looking up common behavioral interview questions and practice answering them off-the-cuff. It may be helpful to get a friend to play the role of interviewer for you and offer their feedback.

When answering these, it's useful to think like a politician. When someone asks you a question, see if you can use it to transition into one of your "talking points". That said, don't think _too much_ like a politician. We expect you to answer our questions, not evade them ;)
