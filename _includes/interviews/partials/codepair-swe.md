The CodePair environment has a feature to run your code. You may use it, but you shouldn't rely on it. If you want to run your code in the interview, ask your interviewer and be sure you know exactly what you expect the code to output. Also be prepared to debug any error messages you might get.

The interview is closed-book (no notes or external websites). You may ask your interviewer questions related to syntax or your general approach to a problem.
