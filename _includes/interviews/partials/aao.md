# Technical Prep

We strongly recommend completing the [Intro to Programming I][aao-ruby-1] and [Intro to Programming II][aao-ruby-2] courses before your interview. This is essential because concepts from the courses may show up in the interview.

The courses include practice problems and video walkthroughs to help you practice your new skills. Make sure you can solve all the problems in 15 minutes or less. Beyond just coding a solution, you will also need to explain your approach in detail. Our video walkthroughs provide a guide for how to verbalize code and strategy clearly.
