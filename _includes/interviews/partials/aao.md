## Intro to Programming Courses

We strongly recommend completing the [Intro to Programming I][aao-ruby-1] and [Intro to Programming II][aao-ruby-2] courses before your interview. This is essential because concepts from the courses may show up in the interview.

The courses include practice problems and video walkthroughs to help you practice your new skills. Make sure you can solve all the problems in 15 minutes or less. Beyond just coding a solution, you will also need to explain your approach in detail. Our video walkthroughs provide a guide for how to verbalize code and strategy clearly.

## Tech Interview Checklist
* [ ] Complete [Intro to Programming I][aao-ruby-1] and [Intro to Programming II][aao-ruby-2] on App Academy Open.
* [ ] Work with the practice problems until you can consistently solve them in 15 minutes or less without running your code until the end.
* [ ] Practice talking through your solutions the way we do in the video walkthroughs. Try explaining your solution to someone else, even if they donâ€™t know any code. Get feedback from them.
* [ ] Practice debugging. You will probably run into bugs during the interview and your ability to diagnose and fix them on the fly says a lot about your coding ability.
* [ ] Practice tracking every variable at throughout your code.
