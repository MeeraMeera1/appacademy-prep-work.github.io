- Complete [Intro to Programming I][aao-ruby-1] and [Intro to Programming II][aao-ruby-2] on App Academy Open.
  - Work with the practice problems until you can consistently solve them in 15 minutes or less without running your code until the end.
  - Practice talking through your solutions the way we do in the video walkthroughs. Try explaining your solution to someone else, even if they donâ€™t know any code. Get feedback from them.
  - Practice debugging. You will probably run into bugs during the interview and your ability to diagnose and fix them on the fly says a lot about your coding ability.
  - Be able to mentally step through your code. Practice until you can track every variable at every line without any trouble.
