This prepwork constitutes a basic introduction to programming designed to be
accessible to everyone. It contains some selected readings to bring you up to
speed on Ruby, plus some exercises for you to complete. All told, we expect the
prepwork to take about 15hrs.

We believe that the time you invest in learning Ruby will be time well spent:
the prep work constitutes a self-contained introductory course in programming,
giving you skills that you will be able to apply to other parts of your life.


## Ruby Setup

If you've already setup ruby, you may skip this section. Otherwise,
please see the [setup instructions][setup] document.

**Note**: The homework problems **will not** be found on Codeacademy - you
**must** setup the web based ruby development environment.

[setup]: ../../coding-test-1/setup

# Required homework

First, do the [required readings][readings].

Please work on and submit these exercises before you arrive
(submission details are below). **These are required**; we want you to
be ready for class when it starts.

[readings]: ../readings

## Test-First Ruby (Alex Chaffee)

[Test-First Ruby][test-first-ruby] is a great way to test your Ruby
knowledge. It gives you interactive feedback, so you can find and
correct mistakes. It will also give you practice running RSpec tests
(complete level 1 of [CodeSchool's RSpec course][codeschool-rspec] if
you need a refresher on RSpec).

[test-first-ruby]: https://github.com/appacademy/test-first-ruby
[codeschool-rspec]: http://rspec.codeschool.com/levels/1

The required exercises are 0-12 and 14. To begin work, go to the
github page and click to download the ZIP file. Extract the ZIP and
open the contained README.md. This will contain further instructions
as to how to proceed.

When you're finished with Test First Ruby, send it to us (instructions
below).

### Errata

**NB: the `rake` task will not work if you save it to a directory path
that includes a space**. For instance, `/Users/FNAME LNAME/learn_ruby`
contains a space. If necessary, move the `learn_ruby` to a directory
path that doesn't contain a space.

## Submitting Your Work

When done, please zip your Test First Ruby folder (complete with
instructions, specs, and your solutions) and mail it to us at
[admissions@appacademy.io](mailto:admissions@appacademy.io).
