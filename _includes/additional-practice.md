One of the best ways to build your programming chops is to get a lot of
practice solving problems and puzzles. This list, while not
comprehensive, is a good starting point (and should keep you occupied
for quite a while).

- [Ruby Monk][ruby-monk]: Interactive lessons from beginning to intermediate Ruby
- [Code Wars][code-wars]: A collection of coding challenges, rated by difficulty. This one is my favorite, since once you solve a problem, you can see other programmers' solutions.
- [Project Euler][project-euler]: More coding challenges. The first few are fairly straightforward and can be brute-forced. As you get further into the challenges, you'll have to be more clever about optimizing your algorithms.
- [Code Eval][code-eval]: More coding challenges, broken into three categories by difficulty. Fairly heavy on file input/output, can be difficult to debug.
- [LeetCode][leetcode]: A platform for preparing for technical coding interviews. The code you submit isn't only evaluated for correctness, but speed as well.
