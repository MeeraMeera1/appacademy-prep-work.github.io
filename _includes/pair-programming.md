# Pair programming

## What is pair programming?

In pair programming, two programmers work together at one workstation.
The **driver** types at the keyboard while the **navigator** directs
the driver. Even though the driver is at the keys, their role is the
more passive; the navigator directs the driver on what to type. The
driver executes their commands.

The foundation of pair programming is communication. Partners must
always be communicating throughout. The navigator directs the driver,
but the driver will often need clarification about what the navigator
intends for them to do. When in disagreement, the pair needs to
discuss the proper course of action.

Students at App Academy spend the majority of their in-class time pair
programming, despite how foreign it may seem at first. To ease the
transition from coding on your own to pair programming, you will be
paired with a Hacker-in-Residence for a portion of the technical
interview. This will give you the opportunity to practice driving /
navigating and ask any questions that arise from a *hands-on*
experience.

## Benefits of pair programming

There are a number of reasons we pair:

1. Pairs are a second pair of eyes. Since most novice mistakes are
   trivial, your pair has a greater chance of immediately identifying
   a problem that could have otherwise taken you a long time to
   discover.
2. Every student will learn different things outside of class; pairing
   is a way to bring that knowledge back into the class and share it
   with other students. This is one of the reasons we have new pairs
  for every project; we want everyone to benefit from everyone else's
  experience.
3. It is important to maintain focus throughout the class day. Working
   solo, it is easy to become distracted or zone out. Working in
   pairs, students help keep each other honest.
4. Working with other people is fun; we do a lot of coding, and it
   ought to be enjoyable.

## The Do's and Don't's of Pair Programming

**Switch: Each partner should spend an equal amount of time in both roles to develop the unique skill sets inherent to each role.**

### Driving

0. We all have strengths and weaknesses, so feel free to verbally help your navigator flesh out their ideas. Just don't go off typing on your own.
0. Be patient. Give your partner some time to come up with a plan of action, even if you have an idea of what you want to do next.

### Navigating

0. Be engaged. Your driver is waiting to execute your algorithm, so do your best to lead yourselves in the right direction.
0. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Navigating doesn't mean you have to know exactly what to do at any given time. Part of what makes pair programming great is integrating the knowledge and tactics of your peers into your own code.
0. Don't micromanage. Your driver understands how to code - you don't have to tell them that an 'if' statement starts with a condition. You just have to tell them what the condition is.
