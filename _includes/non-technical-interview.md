# Next Step: Non-Technical Interview

In order to be a successful software engineer, you don't just need technical skills, you need some soft skills too. This is especially true when interviewing for a job. So now it's time to put the code aside and just chat.

Doing some preparation for this interview is important. This guide will walk you through what you need to do. The interview lasts 15-20 minutes, but you should probably spend up to 5 hours preparing, depending on how much work you've done on your resume and how familiar you are with interviewing and personal sales.

That said, there's no reason to freak out or try to master it all. We don't expect perfection; we're just looking for some potential. See you in the interview!

## The Personal Pitch

> "So, tell me about yourself. What have you done in your career and what brought you here?"

Unnatural as it feels, this formality will likely be the first question you get in a job interview. Since your answer will also be longer than most parts of the conversation, your interviewer is likely to sit back, listen to you talk, and decide whether to take your candidacy seriously. Depending on your interviewer, this can significantly affect the outcome of the entire conversation.
If you're good at selling yourself, this is where you shine. Otherwise no worries. A two-minute, well-rehearsed spiel is all you need to sound prepared and professional.

At App Academy, we use this question to gauge how applicants will fare once they're through our program and interviewing for dev roles. But unlike many of the interviewers you'll encounter, we want to be perfectly clear what we expect of you. We'll give you all the tools you need to succeed. It's up to you to pick them up and use them!

### Your Triangle

People tend to remember things in **threes**. What are the **three** points you want your interviewer to remember? Try to use these ideas:

1. A brief (1min) overview of your past life, i.e. where did you go to school, what did you do after, etc.
2. Why do you want to become a developer?
3. How will App Academy help you achieve your goal? (i.e. Why a bootcamp? Why App Academy specifically?)

Don't overcomplicate this. Keep it easy, fun and simple for you and your interviewer.

### Outline

Here's a sample outline to help you get the idea. You should write down your own outline with the details

#### Beginning

> I went to school at _[...]_ university. In college I chose to major in _[...]_ and took a lot of classes in _[...]_ because I like working on problems that involve _[...]_. Post that I worked at _[...]_ as a _[...]_. At [company] I accomplished _[...]_ and _[...]_ and built skills _z_, _y_ and _x_.

#### Middle

> I've always had an affinity for computers so I taught myself HTML and JavaScript for fun...

#### End

> When I picked up Ruby two years ago, I immediately got hooked. I was playing around on Ruby Monk every day after work. Now I want to learn more because _[... ...]_, and that's when I found App Academy. I really liked how you _[...]_, so I applied.

Notice that each part of the story includes specific details. A few specifics are critical for your listener to fully understand your story. Remember... A story has a beginning, middle and an end (_three_ parts).

### Practice

Having a good Personal Pitch will help your professional development now and down the road. The best way to practice your Personal Pitch is to record yourself. As adults, we learn much faster when we can see and hear ourselves. Also, ask friends or family to listen and provide honest feedback.

When reviewing your pitch check to see that you...

* keep good flow and don't use too many filler words (um, like, so, and).
* speak clearly and confidently.
* don't speak too fast! Remember to _breathe_.
* use good speech dynamics: positive energy, tone and volume.
* speak with your body, not just your voice. This includes eye contact (when appropriate). Remember that people intuitively judge you based on your body language, so it is often _more_ important than what you say.

### Follow-up Questions

Your interviewer will ask you some other questions as well. You should spend some time looking up common behavioral interview questions and practice answering them off-the-cuff. It may be helpful to get a friend to play the role of interviewer for you and offer their feedback.

When answering these, it's useful to think like a politician. When someone asks you a question, see if you can use it to transition into one of your "talking points". That said, don't think _too much_ like a politician. We expect you to answer our questions, not evade them ;)

## Pick your Parameters.

We'll also ask you about your preferred start date and payment plan. We ask all applicants this at this stage.

Check the [list of available dates][course-dates], and pick your first two preferred dates. Bear in mind that cohorts usually fill up 4-6 weeks in advance. If the one you really want isn't available, you should still ask about it as we might be able to fit you in anyway.

Next, look at our [payment plans][payment-plans] and consider which one will best work with your finances. Keep in mind that you will also need to finance the cost of living in the city while looking for a job. This is a process that could take up to a year beyond your 3-month cohort.
