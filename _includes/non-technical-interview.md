# Next Step: Non-Technical Interview

At App Academy, we prioritize having students who are technically strong, but we also value students who are both good communicators and show a conviction for a career in software engineering.

In the non-technical interview, we will be looking for whether you can effectively talk about why you would be a good fit for App Academy, and also whether you can communicate effectively.

In this interview, there are two key components that we would like to learn about you:
- How passionate are you about technology?
- Why are you a good fit for App Academy?

When talking about your passion for technology, be sure to cover:
1. Why are you interested in tech?
2. What made you decide to pursue software more seriously?

When talking about why you would be a good fit for App Academy, be sure to cover:
1. What relevant skills or accomplishments do you have that would show that you are a good fit for App Academy?
2. Why do you want to be a part of App Academy in particular?
