# Next Step: Non-Technical Interview

In order to be a successful software engineer, you don't just need technical skills, you need some soft skills too. This is especially true when interviewing for a job. So now it's time to put the code aside and just chat.

Doing some preparation for this interview is important. This guide will walk you through what you need to do. The interview lasts 15-20 minutes, but you should probably spend 1-5 hours preparing, depending on how much work you've done on your resume and how familiar you are with interviewing and personal sales.

That said, there's no reason to freak out or try to master it all. We don't expect perfection; we're just looking for some potential. See you in the interview!

## What to expect

Be prepared to talk about your background: **_what_**, **_when_**, and **_why_**. This includes any schooling you've had as well as jobs and periods when you were not working or were looking for a job. Generally, the more recent it is, the more important it is to us, but we might ask you about anything.

**_How_** you present yourself and your background is very important, not just what you've done. You should tell us a story that explains why we should accept you into our program.

When it comes to that story, there are two key components that we would like to learn about you:

- How passionate are you about technology?
- Why are you a good fit for App Academy?

See the breakdown for each of these below. Note that we will probably _not_ ask you about these things explicitly. You will have to weave these into your answers to the questions we do ask you.

#### How passionate are you about technology?

Obviously, we want to see some evidence that you like to code. People don't make it through our intense, 12-week program without desiring what's on the other side and enjoying the process a little, too. :smile:

1. Why are you interested in tech?
2. What made you decide to pursue software more seriously?

#### Why are you a good fit for App Academy?

Passion alone will not get you through App Academy. We are a unique bootcamp with our own culture, focus, and pace of teaching. We want to see that you will thrive in the environment we've created here.

1. What relevant skills or accomplishments do you have that would show that you are a good fit for App Academy?
2. Why do you want to attend App Academy in particular?

## Pointers

### Hone your _content_

- Be sure to cover _both aspects_ of _both questions_ listed above, even if we don't ask you directly.
- Be _concise_ in all of your answers. Strip them down to the main points, and leave out the filler words.
- Don't just present the facts; connect the dots for us. How does your unique combination of experiences, talents, and desires mean you'll be a fantastic App Academy student?

### Don't forget about _body language_.

- Try to speak clearly and confidently.
- Be engaging: try to speak expressively and make meaningful eye contact.
- Be positive.
- Make your delivery as fluid as you can.
- Relax. Breathe. Smile :)

## How To Prepare

### Create your content.

- List out your jobs, internships and/or volunteering roles, including dates for everything. Think how best to present it to us.
- Take some time to think through meaningful answers to the questions above.
- Come up with a 2-3 minute personal pitch that tells the whole story of why you'd make an awesome App Academy student.
- Look through our [FAQ][faq], and list out any further questions you may have. You can ask your interviewer when the time comes.

### Practice your delivery.

- Look up some common interview questions and practice answering them.
  - Think like a politician. When someone asks you a question, see if you can use it to transition into one of your "talking points". That said, don't think _too much_ like a politician. We expect you to answer our questions, not evade them :wink:
- Practice out loud.
- Record yourself.
  - This allows you to see how you are presenting yourself and how concise and engaging your answers are.
  - Audio is good; video is _better_.
- Practice interviewing with a friend and get feedback from them.
  - Have your friend ask follow-up questions and see if you can answer them on the fly.
