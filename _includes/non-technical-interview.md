# Next Step: Non-Technical Interview

One of the steps that will help prepare you to be a successful software engineer in the job search now is doing well in a non-technical setting. We’d like for you to begin to think about and practice these skills during your non-technical interview with us. Don’t worry if you are the best at this yet, imagine this as practice! 

The purpose of this interview is to dive deeper into your background, understand your goals and motivations in attending a/A and answer any outstanding questions you may have about the program or admissions process. 

## What to expect

Be prepared to talk about your background: **_what_**, **_when_**, and **_why_**. This includes any schooling you've had as well as jobs and periods when you were not working or were looking for a job.

**_How_** you present yourself and your background is very important, not just what you've done. You should tell us a story that explains why we should accept you into our program.

When it comes to that story, there are two key components that we would like to learn about you:

- How passionate are you about technology?
- Why are you a good fit for App Academy?

Be sure to answer both of these questions, including the two aspects of each listed below.

#### How passionate are you about technology?

Obviously, we want to see some evidence that you like to code. People don't make it through our intense, 12-week program without desiring what's on the other side and enjoying the process a little, too. :smile:

1. Why are you interested in tech?
2. What made you decide to pursue software more seriously?

#### Why are you a good fit for App Academy?

Passion alone will not get you through App Academy. We are a unique bootcamp with our own culture, focus, and pace of teaching. We want to see that you will thrive in the environment we've created here.

1. What relevant skills or accomplishments do you have that would show that you are a good fit for App Academy?
2. Why do you want to attend App Academy in particular?
