# Welcome to App Academy!

Congratulations on your acceptance!

We want to make sure everyone's ready to hit the ground running from day
one, so we've created a prep course to get you up to speed and ready to
enter the program. We know that life is busy, so it's a part-time
course, and it focuses on the basics.

Our onsite program is very fast-paced, and students who fail to prepare
often fall behind and have to leave the program. The sooner you get
started on the prep work, the more time you'll have to practice, and the
more you practice, the less likely this scenario becomes for you.

So make your time count. Don't just breeze through the prep work; get
the full benefit from it. Take your time to practice and review. Make
sure your coding is fluid, your problem-solving skills are sharp, and
your vocabulary of Ruby methods is strong.

# Let's get started!

There are parts of the prep work that you can do immediately, but in
order to access the full curriculum, you'll need to create a Github
account and send it to us first. Follow these steps:

1. **[Sign up for your cohort's mailing list][mailing-signup]**
2. **Request to be added to your cycle's GitHub team**
    * If you haven't already, sign up for an account on [GitHub][github].
    * Email admissions@appacademy.io and request to be added:
        * **Subject**: GitHub Team Request: (Cycle Start Date)
        * **Body**: I am (full name), and I have been accepted into the
          (cycle start date) cycle. My GitHub username is (username) and
          I would like to be added to the cycle GitHub team. Thanks!
3. **[Get started on these required readings][pre-course-readings]**
4. **[Typing practice][typing-practice]**
5. **[Complete the 4-week prep course][appacademy-prep]** (This link will
  be broken until we've added you to our GitHub team.)

  You will find instructions for submitting the prepwork on GitHub once
  you have access. As we said, the course is very intense, and we really
  want you to succeed, so we **require you to complete and submit the
  prep work**.

  We believe that you'll make an awesome developer. **Prove us right!**
