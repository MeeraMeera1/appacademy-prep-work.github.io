Hey all! We're super excited that soon you'll be coming to App
Academy!

We want you to hit the ground running when you arrive; App Academy is
a fast-moving course and we want you be prepared and not fall
behind. For that reason, we have compiled prepwork for you to train up
on and start to flex your Ruby muscles. **Completing the prepwork is
required**.

There are a few things you need to do before you get here:

1. **[Sign up for your cohort's mailing list][mailing-signup]**
2. **Request to be added to your cycle's GitHub team**
    * If you haven't already, sign up for an account on [GitHub][github].
    * Email contact@appacademy.io and request to be added:
        * **Subject**: GitHub Team Request: (Cycle Start Date)
        * **Body**: I am (full name), and I have been accepted into the
          (cycle start date) cycle. My GitHub username is (username) and
          I would like to be added to the cycle GitHub team. Thanks!

4. **[Typing practice][typing-practice]**
5. **[Complete the 4-week prep course][appacademy-prep]** (This link will
  be broken until we've added you to our Github team.)


Students who are successful in the course start the prepwork early; we
strongly recommend that you start it immediately after being accepted.
Don't wait until the last minute to start; you need to practice as much
as you can before the course to maximize what you learn in the course.

The prep work is designed to take about three hours a night over four
weeks; the last day to start is four weeks prior to your cohort's start
date. Starting four weeks before your cohort begins, our TAs will have
office hours between 6:00 and 8:00pm PDT, Monday through Thursday.
During office hours, you can join us in our Slack channel to ask
questions and share pointers with your classmates. You can also ask
questions during the workday; we don’t guarantee you’ll get a response,
but if a TA is available and sees your question, there is a good chance
they will answer it.
