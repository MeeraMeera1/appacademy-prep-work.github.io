## REPL.it

It is not required to install Ruby on your own machine before the
coding challenge. The easiest way to start using Ruby is to use
**[repl.it][https://repl.it]**; it is free.

Here are the key steps:

0. Go to [repl.it][https://repl.it]
0. Select Ruby as your programming language
0. You can choose to sign up for a repl.it account or code anonymously

## Advanced Setup

Setting up Ruby on your machine can be a frustrating process. Setting
up Ruby is not the same as programming; even great Rubyists can be
frustrated by the hoops they have to jump through to setup their
machine. Don't be discouraged if it's difficult!

To install Ruby on Windows, we recommend
[RubyInstaller][ruby-installer]. To install on Mac OSX, check out our
[dotfiles][dotfiles] for more instructions.

[ruby-installer]: http://rubyinstaller.org/
[dotfiles]: https://github.com/appacademy/dotfiles

### Text Editor

You also need a proper code editor; Microsoft's notepad or Mac's
TextEdit won't cut it. We recommend you use [Atom][atom].

[atom]: https://atom.io/

### Terminal

A lot of Ruby development is done at the command line. Mac users can
use Terminal.app.

Windows users can run `cmd`, which is the Windows command line. Run it
by pressing `Windows Key-R` (launches "run program") and typing `cmd`
into the box.
