These questions are meant to prepare you for the coding challenge.
**You should read each question and try to solve them for yourself**.
Solutions are provided, look at those after making your attempt at the
problem. Make sure you understand the solutions.

We've noted a difficulty level for each problem. The easy ones are a
little easier than the problems you'll see on the challenge, the
medium ones are a good proxy for the difficulty of the challenge, and
the hard ones are generally harder than those you'll encounter on the
challenge.

Run the file; if any "false" is output, then your program contains an error.
