Hi there! The final step in your application process is the technical interview. 
To prepare for the interview, look over the prepwork we've
prepared for you. Especially if you're new to coding, this prepwork is
meant to introduce you to the programming concepts you'll need to
succeed during the technical interview.

## tl;dr

Read all of this document. But here's the executive summary:

0. Read the **[Introduction to Programming][intro-to-programming-1]**.
0. Do the **[practice problems][practice-problems]**. Review the
   solutions.

## What is involved in the technical interview?

We will ask you a series of short coding problems that 
measure basic programming knowledge. The questions will be
derived from the prepwork, so make sure you prepare!

## How difficult is the technical interview?

The technical interview is meant to be accessible to everyone. Many
of our applicants have never programmed before. Everyone should review
these prepwork materials, which are intended to teach you the
fundamental concepts of programming so that you can succeed in the
interview.

## How do I setup Ruby?

Please see the [setup instructions][setup] document.

[setup]: ./setup

## How do I prepare for the technical interview?

You will want to prepare for the technical interview so that you do
your best.

**First, you should review our Introduction to Programming**. This
will cover the fundamental concepts of programming you'll need to
know. We recommend that you at least skim them even if you already
know how to program:

* **[Introduction To Programming I][intro-to-programming-1]**
* **[Introduction To Programming II][intro-to-programming-2]**
* **[Introduction To Programming III][intro-to-programming-3]**
* **[Introduction To Programming Summary][intro-to-programming-summary]**

[intro-to-programming-1]: ./introduction-to-programming-1
[intro-to-programming-2]: ./introduction-to-programming-2
[intro-to-programming-3]: ./introduction-to-programming-3
[intro-to-programming-summary]: ./introduction-to-programming-summary

**Second, we provide practice problems**. Do these after you have read
the three parts of Introduction to Programming:

* **[Practice Problems][practice-problems]**

[practice-problems]: ./practice-problems

Doing the practice problems will build your familiarity with Ruby, and
give you a good idea what the level of difficulty is in the technical interview.
It is not required, but we strongly suggest that you
complete all the practice problems before taking the interview. We want you to be well prepared.

**Third, try out the practice coding exercise!** This exercise is designed to
be similar to the difficulty of questions in the technical interview:

* **[Practice Coding Exercise][practice-coding-exercise]**

[practice-coding-exercise]: ./practice-coding-exercise

## What programming language do I write in?

We have designed the interview to be done in Ruby, which is the
language of Rails. The readings and practice problems we've provided
are in Ruby.

You may also answer the interview questions in Python, Java or JavaScript. We will in
no way penalize you for using any of these other languages.

Some languages are not well suited for the technical interview. If you
know another language and would strongly prefer to answer in that,
please contact us: [admissions@appacademy.io][admissions].

[admissions]: mailto:admissions@appacademy.io

## Can I use Google for answers during the technical interview?

**Please do not search Google for answers** to the problems; it is
very easy for us to tell when solutions have been taken from Google.
Please do not post the problems to the internet.
