After you complete the non-technical interview successfully, you'll be
invited to the technical interview. This will test your
ability to apply basic programming principles to solve somewhat more

**Note**: These practice problems will not be found on codeacademy. Instead you
will be running them through a web based development environment. Please see the
[setup ruby instructions][setup] on how to get started.
