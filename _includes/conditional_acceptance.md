# Welcome to App Academy!

Congratulations on your acceptance!

For your next step in the process, we've created a prep course for you
to work through. The prep work is designed to get you up to speed and
ready to enter the program. We know that life is busy, so it's a
part-time course, and it focuses on the basics.

Your full acceptance will depend on our assessment of your final
interview, which we will schedule after you have submitted the prep
work. We expect to see **_marked improvement_** in your coding skills
compared to your previous interviews, so don't just breeze through the
prep work; get the full benefit from it. Take your time to practice and
review. Make sure your coding is fluid, your problem-solving skills are
sharp, and your vocabulary of Ruby methods is strong.

# Let's get started!

There are parts of the prep work that you can do immediately, but in
order to access the full curriculum, you'll need to create a Github
account and send it to us first. Follow these steps:

1. **Request to be added to the GitHub team**
    * If you haven't already, sign up for an account on [GitHub][github].
    * Email admissions@appacademy.io and request to be added:
        * **Subject**: GitHub Team Request: Conditional Acceptance
        * **Body**: I am (full name), and I have been conditionally accepted
          into the App Academy. My GitHub username is (username) and
          I would like to be added to the team. Thanks!
2. **[Do these required readings][pre-course-readings]**
3. **[Typing practice][typing-practice]** (required)
4. **[Complete the 4-week prep course][appacademy-prep]** (This link will
  be broken until we've added you to our GitHub team.)

You will find instructions for submitting the prepwork on GitHub once
you have access. Remember, **you must submit the prepwork** in order to
secure your acceptance, so the sooner you get started on the prep work,
the sooner you can come to App Academy, and the sooner your software
career can take off!

We believe that with practice you have great potential. **Prove us
right!**
