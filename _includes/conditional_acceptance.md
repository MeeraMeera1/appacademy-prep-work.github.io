Welcome to the App Academy prep work!

App Academy is a fast-moving course and we want to know that you'll be
well-prepared and able to keep pace with the curriculum. For that reason,
we've compiled this prep work for you to train on and start to flex your
Ruby muscles. **Completing the prep work is required for your conditional
acceptance.**

There are a few things you need to do before starting the prep work:

* **Request to be added to the GitHub team**
    * If you haven't already, sign up for an account on [GitHub][github].
    * Email contact@appacademy.io and request to be added:
        * **Subject**: GitHub Team Request: Conditional Acceptance
        * **Body**: I am (full name), and I have been conditionally accepted
          into the App Academy. My GitHub username is (username) and
          I would like to be added to the team. Thanks!
* **[Do these required readings][pre-course-readings]**
* **[Typing practice][typing-practice]** (required)

Once you've been added to the GitHub team, you'll be able to access the
preparatory curriculum [here][appacademy-prep].

Students who are successful and end up getting accepted start the prepwork
early; we strongly recommend that you start it immediately, or as soon as
possible. Don't put it off; you need to practice as much as you can
and give yourself time to absorb the material.

The prep work is designed to take about three hours a night over four
weeks, but you're free to take it at whatever pace you feel is appropriate.
TAs will be available for office hours to answer your questions on Slack
between 6:00pm and 8:00pm PDT, Monday through Thursday. You can join us in
our Slack channel to ask questions and share pointers with other students
who have been conditionally accepted. You an also ask questions during the
workday; we don't guarantee that you'll get a response, but if a TA is
available and sees your question, there's a good chance they will answer it.
